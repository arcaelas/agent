# Security Policy for @arcaelas/agent

## Introduction

This document outlines the security considerations, potential vulnerabilities, and best practices when using the `@arcaelas/agent` library.

It is important to note that this tool relies entirely on third-party APIs (OpenAI) and proprietary utilities from Arcaelas Insiders, making it inherently subject to external vulnerabilities that are beyond the direct control of the library’s developers.

## Potential Vulnerabilities

### 1. Risks Inherent to External API Usage (OpenAI)

- **Sensitive Data Leakage**: Data sent during conversations with the agent may be processed and stored by OpenAI servers, posing a potential risk of confidential information leakage.

- **Malicious or Inaccurate Responses**: LLMs may generate misleading, inaccurate, or potentially harmful responses if manipulated through prompt injection attacks.

- **Dependency on External Availability**: Any disruption in OpenAI services will directly impact the functionality of agents built with this library.

### 2. Credential Management and Protection

- **API Key Exposure**: Improper configuration or insecure handling of API keys may lead to unauthorized and potentially costly usage.

- **Credential Compromise Risks**: If credentials for OpenAI or Arcaelas Insiders are compromised, an attacker could abuse resources or access historical conversation data.

### 3. Tool-Related Vulnerabilities

- **Unsafe Code Execution**: Tools implementing code execution, file system access, or external service connections can be exploited if not properly secured.

- **Malicious Parameter Injection**: Lack of validation and sanitization of tool parameters can lead to injection attacks.

- **Unauthorized Access to Functionality**: Without proper authentication and authorization, tools may be misused by unauthorized entities.

### 4. Automated Execution Risks

- **Destructive Automated Actions**: Automating actions based on LLM responses without human verification may lead to destructive or undesired operations.

- **Infinite Loops and Resource Exhaustion**: Although the agent has a 6-cycle limit, poor configuration could result in execution loops that exhaust system resources.

## Recommendations to Mitigate Risks

### 1. Input/Output Validation and Sanitization

- Strictly validate all parameters received by agent tools.
- Sanitize all outputs generated by the model before processing or displaying them.
- Set clear limits on the size and content of inputs and outputs.

### 2. Auditing and Logging

- Maintain detailed logs of all agent interactions, especially those involving tools with access to critical systems.
- Implement an alerting system to detect unusual or suspicious usage patterns.
- Regularly review logs to identify potential vulnerabilities or exploitation attempts.

### 3. Credential Protection

- Never hardcode API keys in source code.
- Use environment variables or secure secret management systems.
- Rotate credentials regularly and follow the principle of least privilege.
- Use tokens with limited scope and expiration where possible.

### 4. Secure Development Practices

- Keep the library updated with the latest security patches.
- Integrate security checks into your CI/CD pipeline.
- Conduct regular security audits on code and dependencies.
- Consider implementing throttling mechanisms to prevent abuse.

## Vulnerability Reporting Policy

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability in `@arcaelas/agent`, please report it immediately via the following channels:

- **Email**: [community@arcaelas.com](mailto:community@arcaelas.com) with the subject “\[SECURITY] Vulnerability in @arcaelas/agent”
- **GitHub**: Open a confidential issue at [https://github.com/arcaelas/agent/security/advisories/new](https://github.com/arcaelas/agent/security/advisories/new)

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: You will receive confirmation within 24 hours of reporting.
2. **Initial Assessment**: The security team will assess the reported issue within 72 hours.
3. **Mitigation Plan**: A plan will be created to fix the issue, and you will be informed of the expected timeline.
4. **Patch and Release**: Critical vulnerabilities will be addressed with top priority, with a target of releasing a fix within 7 days.

### Responsible Disclosure

We kindly request that you:

- Provide sufficient detail to reproduce and address the vulnerability.
- Allow reasonable time for a fix before disclosing publicly.
- Do not exploit the vulnerability to access unauthorized data or disrupt the service.

## User Responsibility

It is the responsibility of users of `@arcaelas/agent` to implement secure and prudent practices in their deployments. This includes:

- Carefully reviewing all custom tools before integration.
- Keeping dependencies and the library itself up to date.
- Implementing additional layers of validation for critical inputs and outputs.
- Defining strict boundaries for the agent’s capabilities.
- Never blindly trusting LLM-generated responses when critical systems are involved—always verify.
